-> Local state
    states are use in manupulate in with in component internally
    We pass data internally with props to the child 

-> Global State
  it share data across all the components 
  
-> to deal with it has several 
  lifting up the state  and Context
    -> lifting up state
    When we share some portion of a state with multiple components, we can use a technique 
    it is the process of moving the shared portion of the state to a common parent element 

      
    
    -> Context or ContextAPI
      it is used to manage the global state. For this, we don't need any 3rd party library 

      lifting up state have problem that is props drelling

        data  -------------------
            \                   |
             \                  |
             data               |       is called props drelling
                 \              | 
                  \             |
                  data          | 
                     \          | 
                      \         |
                      data      |    
                         \      |
                           \    | 
                             data
    
      to avoid this props drelling  problem context are used 

   -> 3 steps involed in context API
    1. create Context
    2. Provider
    3. Consumer
    -> first we create a context and provide that context to the prarent component with values
       and we consume this context in any of the child and subchild of the parent component any where.
    ->  when there is any change in the context it automatically updated where it is consume..
