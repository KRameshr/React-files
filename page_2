         -> public :- where we define our public files like assets and all
            -> index.html : it is a main file which execute when react
               application is running
               <div id="root"></div>

         index.html it is main entery file

hoew react application is boot or execute
index.html
<div id = "root"></div> ---> src/index.js --> it get the id root form index.html and load the app componet in the div id root.

{conditiona ?  true : false}

props (properties)  : props are used to pass data from  parent to child component and  props are read only..
