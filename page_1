React


-> It is an Open-source, Cross platform JavaScript library which is used to develop UI(Front End)
-> Maintain by Facebook(Meta) was Released in 2013
   -> react is all about the Components
   -> we can divide Our application into a small piracies of code with help of Component.
-> It is used to develop SPA(Single Page Application)
  SPA(Single Page Application)
  performance is of web application is very past

  example
    Gmail
    flip Card....etc

-> Advantages

1. Scalable
ReactJS works well with all sizes of applications as it is used in some of the biggest web applications, such as Facebook, Instagram, etc.

2. Compositional UI
Using ReactJS, we can compose our user interface using small reusable components that can be modified or even replaced if needed.

3. Portable
React components are quite portable and can be moved from one project to another, as long as both projects use ReactJS.

4. Performant
Instead of a real browser DOM, ReactJS uses a virtual DOM that gives it a massive performance boost when it comes to DOM manipulation.


ReactJS Disadvantages
Learning Curve: ReactJS has a steep learning curve as it requires a big shift in the mental model of how we think about building user interfaces.

Documentation: ReactJS rolls out updates and new features at a fast rate due to which the documentation might not always be present or good enough.

JSX: To work with React, we need to learn how to use JSX, which can be a bit difficult as it makes us use HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript files.

State Management: Depending on how our application is structured, managing the state and sharing it among components can be very difficult.

What is DOM?
  DOM stands for document object model. It is a tree-like structure that is used to represent HTML documents 
  DOM creates a hierarchical structure that can then be used by programming languages, like JavaScript, to interact with and manipulate

example 
  <!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> DOm Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button id="btn"> Add Task</button>
        <ul id="list"></ul>
        <script>
            const btn=document.getElementById("btn");
            const list=document.getElementById("list");
            let index=1;
            btn.addEventListener("click",()=>{
                let element=document.createElement("li");
                element.textContent=`Task ${index++}`;
                list.appendChild(element);
            })
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

ReactDOM:
- Versatility of React: React can be used to build applications for multiple platforms such as web, mobile, or even virtual reality (VR).
- Web Integration: To use React in a web application, we need it to be able to access and manipulate the DOM. For that, ReactDOM is used.
- Technical Definition: ReactDOM is a package that contains DOM-specific methods used by React to enable itself to interact with the DOM.


UI Development Without ReactJS

  Building a user interface without ReactJS is possible, but for reasonably sized applications, it presents several key challenges.

1. Decomposition

   Without ReactJS: Developers must manually create HTML tags and use JavaScript to add event-handling code to wire everything up.
   Using React: Developers can create small, isolated individual components, which are then composed together to create the entire UI.

2. State Management
   Definition: State refers to the data that an application stores in memory to be displayed later, such as previously sent messages in a    chat app.
   The Challenge: Data often changes while being displayed (e.g., a total price in a shopping cart updating when an item is added).
   React's Solution: React ensures that data and its display stay in sync. When data changes, all components displaying that data are automatically updated.

3. Performance
  The Challenge: Adding and removing elements directly from the DOM tree is a very intensive operation that can cause performance issues.
  React's Solution: React solves this by using a Virtual DOM and updates components as effectively as possible.

4. Debugging
 Without ReactJS: Debugging the UI can be very challenging, even with standard browser inspect tools.
 Using React: React developer tools (available as browser extensions) greatly simplify the process of debugging components.

example 
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
function render(children) {
  const root = document.getElementById("root");
  root.appendChild(children);
  return root;
}

function h1(children) {
  const element = document.createElement("h1");
  root.appendChild(children);
  return element;
}

function text(children) {
  return document.createTextNode(children);
}

render(h1(text("Hello World")));

E6 Features
var global scope
let and const is block scope

function Car(){
  let v = 10;
  const y = 30;
  var c = 20;
console.log(c);
}

Car()
arrow function
class
class Car{
  constructor(){
    this.speed = 100;
  }
  
  acc(){
    this.speed += 200;
  }
  speedCar(){
   console.log(this.speed) 
  }
}

const c = new Car();
c.acc();
c.speedCar();

Destaturer


const empdat = {
  name: "Ramesh",
  age :20,
  
}

const {name, age} = empdat;

console.log(name)
console.log(empdat.age)


callback / async ,await/ promise


function getU(uid){
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log("User get from db");
      resolve({User:"anuj"})
    }, 2000);
  })
}


function getC(user){
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log("User get cour from db");
      resolve(["a","b"])
    }, 2000);
  })
}

async  function  details(){
  try{ let us = await getU(101)
   let rs = await getC(us)
  console.log(rs)}catch(e){console.log(e)}
 
}
