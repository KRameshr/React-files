In react we have some rules to use css(jsx)

inlile style
<h2 style ={{}} -- </h2>

npm i boostrap --save

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js";


state are manage data components mutable 
props are immutabel  ready 

before 16.8 v we cannot manage state in a function componets.but in 16.8 version react introduced 
hook and other feacture and form ther we can magnage state in function comp
useState() hook to manage state 

syntax :
const [staename, handle] = useState(initialValue)
statenaem =  name of the state
handler = method to update state date 

eg 
 import{useState} from "react";
 const [count,setcount] = useState(0)

 readstae
 {count}
 update state
 setcount(count+1)

-> Hooks : introduced in react 16.8 version and used only in function component.
These are the functions use to improve code organization and reusability.
  -> useState() :- to manage state within a component and they are mutable (we can
  change the state value)
    syntax :
    const [statename,handler]=useState(initialValue);
    eg:
    import {useState} from 'react';
    const [count,setCount]=useState();

-> useEffect() :- to manage side effects. It work as a lifecycle method of the
function component for all phases like mounting , updating and unmounting.
  syntax :
    -> Mounting : when a component is initilized or loaded
      useEffect(()=>{
        //code
      },[]);
-> Updating : when there is any update in state or props
    useEffect(()=>{
      //code
    },[state,props]);
  -> Unmounting : when we leave from the component (cleanup date)
    useEffect(()=>{
      //code
      return ()=>{
        //cleanup data
      }
    },[]);


sort command to carete function component

Custom hook (crete our own hook) (reusability)
hooks are start wiht prefix use


Rules on hooks
   Top Level calls
    Call from React Function or call in custom Hook

useRef
 it allows to directly create a refrecnce to the DOM element inthe  function component if we change the value of useref it will not re-render the webpage as state it preserve values across various re-render it return a mutabel object
this object have a current property 

impport {useRef} from "react";
const myRef = useRef();
myRef.current.value
 <input type="text" className="form-control" ref={inputRef} />

UseMemo
is designed to optimize performance by memoizing expensive computation.
react store the result of a  function call and reuse it when the dependency of that function haven't changed, rather than recalculating the value on every render,
computation the values meams calculating the values


UseCallback

UseReducer
it si complex problem

UseContext(state ManageMent)
   in react context object is special object managed by react which can be used to share data between sibling components
