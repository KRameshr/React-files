In react we have some rules to use css(jsx)

inlile style
<h2 style ={{}} -- </h2>

npm i boostrap --save

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js";


state are manage data components mutable 
props are immutabel  ready 

before 16.8 v we cannot manage state in a function componets.but in 16.8 version react introduced 
hook and other feacture and form ther we can magnage state in function comp
useState() hook to manage state 

syntax :
const [staename, handle] = useState(initialValue)
statenaem =  name of the state
handler = method to update state date 

eg 
 import{useState} from "react";
 const [count,setcount] = useState(0)

 readstae
 {count}
 update state
 setcount(count+1)

hooks interoduce in react 16.8 version  and used only in function components 
there are the function use to improve code organization and reusablility
-> useState() ;- to mange state with in component and they are mutable, we can change the state value
-> useEffect() to manage side effect it work as a life cycle method of the 
function component for all phases like mounting, updating, and unmounting

syntex 
Mounting :  when a component is initilized or loaded 
useEffect(()=> {
// code
},[]);

updating :when there is any upate in dependecy (state or props) 
useEffect(()=> {
// code
},[state, props]);

unmouting when we leave from the component (clean up date)


useEffect(()=> {
// code
return () => {
// cleanup data 
}
},[ ]);
