In react we have some rules to use css(jsx)

inlile style
<h2 style ={{}} -- </h2>

npm i boostrap --save

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js";


state are manage data components mutable 
props are immutabel  ready 

before 16.8 v we cannot manage state in a function componets.but in 16.8 version react introduced 
hook and other feacture and form ther we can magnage state in function comp
useState() hook to manage state 

syntax :
const [staename, handle] = useState(initialValue)
statenaem =  name of the state
handler = method to update state date 

eg 
 import{useState} from "react";
 const [count,setcount] = useState(0)

 readstae
 {count}
 update state
 setcount(count+1)

-> Hooks : introduced in react 16.8 version and used only in function component.
These are the functions use to improve code organization and reusability.
  -> useState() :- to manage state within a component and they are mutable (we can
  change the state value)
    syntax :
    const [statename,handler]=useState(initialValue);
    eg:
    import {useState} from 'react';
    const [count,setCount]=useState();

-> useEffect() :- to manage side effects. It work as a lifecycle method of the
function component for all phases like mounting , updating and unmounting.
  syntax :
    -> Mounting : when a component is initilized or loaded
      useEffect(()=>{
        //code
      },[]);
-> Updating : when there is any update in state or props
    useEffect(()=>{
      //code
    },[state,props]);
  -> Unmounting : when we leave from the component (cleanup date)
    useEffect(()=>{
      //code
      return ()=>{
        //cleanup data
      }
    },[]);


sort command to carete function component

Custom hook (crete our own hook) (reusability)
hooks are start wiht prefix use
