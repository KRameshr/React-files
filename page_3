inlile style
<h2 style ={{}} -- </h2>

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js";


state are manage data components mutable 
props are immutabel  ready 

before 16.8 v we cannot manage state in a function componets.but in 16.8 version react introduced 
hook and other feacture and form ther we can magnage state in function comp
useState() hook to manage state 

syntax :
const [staename, handle] = useState(initialValue)
statenaem =  name of the state
handler = method to update state date 

eg 
 import{useState} from "react";
 const [count,setcount] = useState(0)

 readstae
 {count}
 update state
 setcount(count+1)
